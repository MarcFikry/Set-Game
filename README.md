# Set â€“ Python Game Project

This is a Python implementation of the logic game **Set**, developed as a semester project for **INF204 (UE)** during the second semester of my first year.

The game features both textual and graphical interfaces using Python's built-in **Turtle** module and supports:
- Automatic simulation mode
- Human player mode (with score tracking)
- Visual display of cards
- Set detection and highlighting

---

## Features

- Card representation with 4 attributes: color, shape, texture, number
- Randomized deck initialization and card drawing
- Graphical interface for card display (with preloaded images)
- Automatic gameplay and statistical analysis
- Multiplayer mode with score tracking
- "Help" option for players to receive assistance

- Turtle module (comes with standard Python)
- A folder named `images/` with the required `.gif` files for cards:
  - Format: `forme_couleur_texture.gif` (e.g., `ovale_rouge_plein.gif`)

### Running the Game

To start the game:
